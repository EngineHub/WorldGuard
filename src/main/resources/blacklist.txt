#
# This is the blacklist for WorldGuard. The blacklist allows you to perform
# actions depending on an item or block ID. Comments start with # and they
# are ignored so you can put your own notes.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# WARNING:
# Remember to check the compatibility spreadsheet for WorldGuard to see
# if any events or actions are currently broken in your version of Bukkit.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Format:
# [item1,item2]
# option1=options
# event1=whatToDo1,whatToDo2,whatToDo3
# event2=whatToDo1,whatToDo2
#
# Example to block some ore mining and placement:
# [coalore,goldore,ironore]
# on-break=deny,log,kick
# on-place=deny,tell
#
# Options:
# - ignore-groups (comma-separated list of groups to not affect)
# - comment (message for yourself that is printed with 'log' and 'notify')
# - message (optional message to show the user instead; %s is the item name)
#
# Events:
# - on-break (when a block of this type is about to be broken)
# - on-destroy-with (the item/block held by the user while destroying)
# - on-place (a block is being placed)
# - on-use (an item like flint and steel or a bucket is being used)
# - on-interact (when a block in used (doors, chests, etc.))
# - on-drop (an item is being dropped from the player's inventory)
# - on-acquire (an item enters a player's inventory via some method)
#
# Actions (for events):
# - deny (deny completely, used blacklist mode)
# - allow (used in whitelist mode)
# - notify (notify admins)
# - log (log to console/file/database)
# - tell (tell a player that that's not allowed)
# - kick (kick player)
# - ban (ban player)
#
# Users with the /worldguardnotify permission will receive notifications.
#
# -------------
#
# You can have the same block or item used in two different sections and
# they will both apply:
#
# [goldblock]
# ignore-groups=vip
# on-break=deny
# [goldblock]
# ignore-groups=admins
# on-break=tell
#
# However, some events override others. For example, if you disable both
# usage of the diamond pickaxe (with the on-destroy-with event) and
# destruction of gold blocks (with the on-break event) and a player tries
# to destroy a gold block with a diamond pickaxe, because the
# on-destroy-with event comes first, the rules for the gold block
# will not be applied (but the player will be denied nevertheless).
#

# Some examples follow.
#
# REMEMBER: If a line has # in front, it will be ignored.
