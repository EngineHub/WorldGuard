# Changelog

## 7.0.4 (including beta1)

* Add support for MC 1.16. Dropped support for previous versions.
* Add respawn-anchors flag mirroring the sleep flag (e.g. to prevent using respawn anchors to cause explosions in the overworld)
* Add nether vines to vine-growth flag.
* Add config option to disable the bypass permission cache.
* Fix water-flow flags not checking waterlogged blocks.
* Add config option to consider non-player causes (e.g. pistons, flowing water) to only be members of the highest priority region. This should be enabled for plots-within-city-like setups to prevent things in plots from modifying the city.
* Fix items dropping from falling blocks that were suppressed by other plugins.
* Add config option to block turtle egg trampling.
* Fix ride flag being checked on striders that didn't have saddles.
* Add config option to have /rg bypass toggled off on login.
* Developer changes: Methods taking names in Domains are now explicitly deprecated (was previously just a javadoc comment.); These will eventually be removed: there is no reason to use names over UUIDs. Offline players and NPCs alike have stable UUIDs.
* Also for developers; The new `com.sk89q.worldguard.protection.util.WorldEditRegionConverter` class has some useful static methods to convert to and from WorldEdit's Region and WorldGuard's ProtectedRegion classes.


## 7.0.3

* This is the last release supporting MC 1.14 and 1.15.
* Decouple chest-access flag from interact flag. IMPORTANT: If you relied on allowing players to access chests via setting
    the interact flag to allow, you will now need to set the chest-access flag to allow instead (or as well). This does not
    affect any setups where users were *not* supposed to be able to access chests and other inventories.
* Add natural-health-regen and natural-hunger-drain flags. Unlike the heal/feed flags, these can not restore or deplete health/hunger.
* Fix the interact flag allowing breaking of turtle eggs (now tied directly to block-trampling flag).
* Fix a memory leak that could occur with many many explosives.
* Add regions.titles-always-use-default-times config option. Set this to true if you use greeting/farewell titles and another plugin
    makes the titles disappear too quickly.
* Add protection for cauldrons water level changing.
* Improve diagnostic hints and information, such as spawn protection warnings, flag colors in region info, etc.
* Fix waterlogged blocks bypassing water-flow flag.
* Workaround for a CraftBukkit change that made no-physics-sand/gravel non-functional.
* Workaround for CraftBukkit throttling move events.
* Track projectiles shot by dispensers.
* Allowed setting passthrough allow on global to unprotect it if members/owners are added.
* Add support for newer forge clients (FML2) in host keys.
* Allow using WorldEdit's `//world <worldname>` command to select a world for region commands. This removes the need to
    use `-w <worldname>` in every command when running commands from console.
* Add a teleport-message flag, shown when using `/rg tp`.
* Add coral-fade flag, which prevents corals from drying when out of water.
* Fix spammy deny-message when walking over redstone ore with certain flag setups.
* Improve handling of interacting with various tools in hand that didn't modify blocks. (eg opening a chest with an axe in hand)
* Fix allow-all-interact option not being read from per-world configs.
* Fix misattribution of pets (eg wolves) in PvP.
* Improve performance of hopper checks when on recent builds of Paper.
* Add event-handling.break-hoppers-on-denied-move config option to prevent hoppers from being broken (but items still won't be moved).
* Note to developers using the WorldGuard API: If you specifically relied on flags such as greeting/farewell, deny-message, etc being
    StringFlags, be warned that this will change in a future version to support JSON text components. Please plan accordingly.


## 7.0.2
* Update to MC 1.15. Still compatible with 1.14, and incompatible with 1.13, as before.
* Add an informational message when defining a region that overlaps vanilla spawn protection.
* Protect against pushing a piston with another piston on a region border.
* Protect against buckets in dispensers on region borders.

## 7.0.1

* Fix some checks for adding owners to unclaimed regions.
* Fix an issue with time-/weather-lock flags when logging in to a region with the flag set.
* Fix cause tracking in vehicles (incl. breaking lilypads in a boat)
* Use async teleports on Paper.
* Include hopper minecarts in the ignore hoppers config setting.
* Add sugar cane and cacti to the crop-growth flag. Bamboo is also included pending Spigot throwing an event for it.
* Specifically track when players ignite creepers with flint and steel.
* Fix fuzziness when using bonemeal near a protected region.
* Fix color codes not applying in greeting, etc flags when placed after a newline (\n).

* Fix pistons flag not applying to sticky pistons pulling blocks.
* Add some custom metrics for bStats.
* Everything in the RC/beta changelog below.

## 7.0.1 RC 2 (inc. beta 1)
* Due to breaking changes in important Bukkit API, this is not compatible with MC 1.13!
* Update to MC 1.14. Adds protection for new blocks, etc.
* To allow players to read from lecterns, but not take the book, flag interact allow, and then flag chest-access -g nonmembers deny.

* Fix overprotection of unsaddled pigs with the ride flag.
* Fix lava fire defaulting to off (won't change existing configs).
* Fix damaged/chipped anvils not respecting use flag like regular anvils.
* Add on-equip blacklist event. Note that it is overprotective due to deficiencies in Bukkit API.
* Update WorldEdit CUI when using /rg select.
* Add config option to disable villagers getting zapped into witches. ("weather.disable-villager-witchification")
* Add entity support to interact-whitelist config option (use the Material of the corresponding item).

* Fix config options taking material lists requiring "minecraft:" namespace.
* Fix disallowed-lightning-blocks situationally not working.
* Fix errors that occurred when plugins used falling block entities with non-item materials.
* Add special support for Paper servers (papermc.io): Paper's API allows us to track who launched fireworks.
* Fireworks are now protected by default. On Paper servers, members can use them by default (to deal damage), 
on non-Paper servers, flag firework-damage allow to revert to old behavior (everyone can deal damage with fireworks by default).
* Misc performance enhancements for Paper servers.
* Add 'regions.use-paper-entity-origin' as an experimental setting (default off) for Paper servers. Enabling it will make non-player entities be treated as members of the place they spawned, instead of their current location when flags are checked.

## 6.0 beta 2

* Added an `-e` parameter to `/rg flag` that sets the flag to an empty value. You can use this to, for example, make it so the `deny-message` flag is empty, meaning that players won't get a message at all.
* Added a visual smoke effect when an action on a block has been denied.
* Added `event-handling.interaction-whitelist`, a list of items or blocks that should never be protected. For example, adding `wooden_door` to the list would make it so that doors could be used by anyone regardless if they have permission or not. You may still protect the blocks via other means.
* Added `event-handling.emit-block-use-at-feet`, a list of items that, when used, will also be considered as the player using that item on the block at the player's feet. The purpose of this setting is, for example, to allow you to (sort of) prevent the use of a mod-added item that does not emit events.
* Added `-s` to silently turn toggle `/stoplag` and `-i` to show the current state of the setting. (Thanks, [stuntguy3000](https://github.com/stuntguy3000)).

* Fixed [#3166](http://youtrack.sk89q.com/issue/WORLDGUARD-3166): Trees do not grow naturally within protected regions

## 6.0 beta 1

### UUID support

Regions now fully support the use of UUIDs rather than names for storing the owners and members of a region. Commands still accept names, but they are translated into UUIDs in the background. For users who already have existing region data, names will be automatically converted to UUIDs on the first run of WorldGuard.

It is still possible to specify names rather than a UUID by using the `-n` flag with the region membership commands.

### 'Deny by default'

Previously, a pre-determined list of blocks and entities was used to determine whether an action by the player should be blocked. However, this has been reversed so that every action on a block or entity is denied (in a protected region) unless it has been deemed safe (such as, for example, right clicking with steak). Mods are now supported as a result.

The `USE` flag has been repurposed as a general "interaction" flag and covers every left click or right click of a block or entity. It also covers interaction that falls outside clicking.

### Exhaustive protection

More events are now handled in the protection code. For example,

* It is no longer possible to drop sand or gravel into a protected region from outside.
* It is no longer possible to grief a region by growing a tree into it.
* The entry and exit flags now handle players sitting on vehicles properly.
* Piston-moved blocks cannot be pushed into a different protected region.
* Owners of tamable animals are now considered in protection code.

Even water and lava flow can also be checked, although this requires that it be explicitly enabled in the configuration (flow events are very frequent, so they incur extra CPU cost).

The goal is to provide extremely exhaustive protection.

### Large performance boost for spatial queries

The performance of spatial queries for regions has been substantially increased at least an order of magnitude. Spatial queries are a necessity for the region code to query the list of regions that apply to a location in the world. There should be a negligible difference between 4, 40, and 4000 regions as long as too many regions are not overlapping.

### Background region operations

Region commands are now executed in the background. Notably, saves and loads will not lock up your server while they complete. Additionally, changes to regions are now saved periodically rather than immediately after every change.

### Updated MySQL region support

MySQL support has been completely overhauled. It should now be faster, no longer crash on foreign key index errors, use transactions, and support automatic creation and migration of tables (including support for table prefixes).

### Partial region data saving

For users of MySQL, WorldGuard now only saves changed and deleted regions when saving region data. No longer does WorldGuard have to rewrite the entire region database on each save.

### Improved handling of related flags

Multiple flags that apply to an event are now evaluated together if they are similar. For example, if a player right clicks a bed to sleep in it, both the `USE` and `SLEEP` flag are checked since they are both interaction-related. If one of them is `DENY`, then sleeping is denied (remember, `DENY` overrides `ALLOW`). If one of them is `ALLOW` and the other is not `DENY`, then sleeping is permitted.

Only one "category" of flags needs to evaluate to true to permit an action. `DENY` will not cross categories. For example, if `BUILD` is deny, it will not override `SLEEP`, so if `SLEEP` is set to `ALLOW`, sleeping will be permitted. This is fairly similar to how it worked on WorldGuard 5.

### Flag groups now work properly

While you could always set a group to a flag's value, the functionality was incomplete and did not work most of the time.

Now that groups are supported, you can change a flag so it only applies to a certain group of players. For example, `/rg flag example sleep deny -g members` would deny sleeping for only members of the `example` region.

### Inheritance now works as expected

Previously, a region only inherited flags and other details from its parents if the parent and the child overlapped at the location queried. This is no longer the case and inheritance is now always applied. 

In addition, a new `-g` flag for `/rg define` lets you create a region with no physical area so that you can assign flags and use this region as a "template region."

### Settable deny message

It is now possible to change the message that users get when they are prevented from interacting with blocks or entities. This message is defined as a region flag, so you can set it on the `__global__` region or override it in a specific region. In addition, the tone and color of the default message has been softened, but you are free to change it entirely.

### Blacklist support for data values (and later, variants)

The blacklist was rewritten to support more than just block and item IDs. The immediate result is that you can now use data values, but as those are in the process of being deprecated by Mojang, it also allows support for Minecraft's new block variants in the future.

### Debounced events

Events that tend to reoccur very frequently (such as the ones that occur when you stand on a pressure plate continuously) have been "debounced" to reduce the number of checks that WorldGuard has to perform, reducing the amount of wasted CPU. In addition, the "you don't have permission" message is rate limited so players are not flooded with the message.

### New block place and break flags

A long requested feature was the availability of block place and break flags. These newly added flags work in tandem with the `BUILD` flag but can override `BUILD`. At the moment, it is not possible to allow explicit types of blocks to be placed or broken yet.

### Build permission nodes

A new optional (disabled by default in the configuration) feature is the checking of build permission nodes. For every block, entity, and item, the following permission nodes are checked:

* Block place: `worldguard.build.block.place.<material>`
* Block break: `worldguard.build.block.remove.<material>`
* Block interact: `worldguard.build.block.interact.<material>`
* Entity spawn: `worldguard.build.entity.place.<type>`
* Entity destroy: `worldguard.build.entity.remove.<type>`
* Entity interact: `worldguard.build.entity.interact.<type>`
* Entity damage: `worldguard.build.entity.damage.<type>`
* Item use: `worldguard.build.item.use.<material>`

In addition, the permissions are also checked in the style of `worldguard.build.block.<material>.<action>`, so `worldguard.build.block.<material>.place` would work too.

The list of usable material names comes from the [Material enumeration in Bukkit](http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html). For example, the permission for placing the bed block would be `worldguard.build.build.place.bed_block`. Be aware that _Material_ contains both item and block names.

For entity names, see [EntityType](http://jd.bukkit.org/rb/apidocs/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html).

### Other changes

* Added a setting to permit "fake players" to bypass protection. Fake players are used by some servers and some mods to allow events to be thrown for mod blocks. WorldGuard considers a player to be a fake player if the name starts with `[` and ends with `]`.
* Added a check so players can no longer disembark in a region from their tamed animal if they don't have permission to get back on.
* Added an item pickup flag to go along with the item drop flag.
* Added a new `//running` command was added to show currently running background tasks.
* Added a blacklist `on-dispense` event.
* Added more detailed error messages when parsing the YAML regions file.
* Added the `-Dworldguard.debug.listener=true` option that can be set on your server's command line to see how WorldGuard processes events, although this will result in a lot of log messages.
* Added log messages that occur on player join when a player had auto-god mode or auto-amphibious mode.
* Fixed the heal command so that it now sets a player's health to the maximum rather than 20.
* Fixed `ProtectedCuboidRegion.getPoints()` returning points in wrong order.
* Fixed the obsidian generator disable option to also apply to tripwire.
* Fixed an error with the blocked commands flag.
* Fixed a connection leak with the MySQL region code.
* Fixed `/wg reload` sometimes not applying new changes right away.
* Changed the region removal command so that child regions are no longer removed without warning when removing the parent region.
* Changed the YAML region data save code to first write the data to a temporary file before replacing the final file.
* Changed how region data is handled when region support is disabled: it is no longer loaded.
* Changed sponges to now be disabled by default. However, if you had previously installed WorldGuard, sponges will still be enabled. Sponges are being added in Minecraft and they work differently than in Minecraft Classic (which WorldGuard emulates). In addition, enabling sponge support in WorldGuard incurs extra CPU cost even if no sponges exist in the world.
* Changed how region data is loaded and saved so failures are now more graceful. If the region data fails to load for a world, then the entire world will be protected by default. In addition, periodic attempts will be made to load the region data in the background.
* Changed the `FEED` flag to maximize the player's saturation level if the hunger level is raised.
* Changed the `wg-invincible` and `wg-amphibious` groups feature so that it now must be enabled in the configuration.
* Removed the ability for WorldGuard to upgrade from a version for Minecraft Alpha.

### API changes

* You can use a new `WorldGuardPlugin.createProtectionQuery()` method to easily check build permissions.
* The listener classes were moved. Consider them internal -- if you want to make use of the listener somehow, please put in a ticket in our issue tracker.
* Much of the protection-related handling was previously scattered throughout the code. Now WorldGuard funnels events into an internal event system and then processes protection queries in a more consistent matter. These events are for internal use so it is strongly recommended that you do not use them (they may change without notice drastically). A lot of the protection-related flag handling was moved there.
* A significant portion of classes under the package of `com.sk89q.worldguard.protection` were changed or removed. However, the basic calls (testing the value of a flag, etc.) should still work, but they may be deprecated. Some of the utility `Domain`-related classes were removed.
* The old region database (load/save) API was removed and replaced with a new one. The new one no longer needs to pointless store a collection of regions on itself -- it has `collection = load()` and `save(collection)` methods.
* Previously, there were subclasses of `RegionManager` that implemented different spatial indices. However, now `RegionManager` is a final class and the spatial indices are separate (see the `RegionIndex` interface).
* A hash table was implemented that caches a list of regions within each loaded chunk. This increases performance of spatial queries substantially.
* A cache of recent spatial queries now exists (a cache of `ApplicableRegionSets`), but you need to make use of `RegionQuery` to make use of this cache. However, if you need to do a spatial query to modify region data, then the old method is better (get a `RegionManager`, etc.).
* `ApplicableRegionSet` was converted into an interface. In addition, there are now "virtual" `ApplicableRegionSet` instances that are returned by `RegionQuery` for certain special cases (such as, for example, region support being disabled by the user or region data being unavailable for a world due to an error). A new `isVirtual()` method is available. This is not an issue if you are getting `ApplicableRegionSet` instances from a `RegionManager`.
* `ApplicableRegionSet` now can accept a pre-sorted collection and its use of a `TreeSet` was removed for performance reasons.
* `FileNotFoundException` is now properly handled in the YAML region file class. It creates the new file and continues on.
* Player names are deprecated by Mojang and so they need to be converted into UUIDs. As this will take some time, you should do this conversion in a background task. To check whether a region contains a player, it recommended that `contains(LocalPlayer)` be used because it's possible that the user may be still using names. A new `WorldGuardPlugin.wrapOfflinePlayer()` method was added for this specific purposes.
* All flags now use `RegionGroup.ALL` as the default region group.
* `StateFlag.getDefault()` now returns a `State` rather than a `boolean`.
* The priority R-tree index now uses the R-tree for region intersection queries. Previously, it was only used for single point containment queries.
* Regions now keep a "dirty" flag and changes it whenever data within the region is changed. When WorldGuard decides to periodically save region data, it may only save changed regions. Calling `save()` on the `RegionManager` is no longer needed as periodical saves happen automatically.
* The old region data migration API was removed in favor of region store drivers. There is no longer a need to have an implementation for every possible conversion (i.e. YAML -> MySQL, MySQL -> YAML, etc.).
* `ProtectedRegion.copyFrom()` was added to copy region settings from another region.
* `@Nullable` annotations were added throughout the code. If you use IntelliJ IDEA, you may notice that it now warns you when a return value may be `null`.

* Blacklist hooks have CHANGED. The new hooks are work better. on-create has been replaced with on-place (for block placement) and on-use (for item usage, light buckets and lighters). The old on-use is now on-right-click although it currently does nothing.
* Added coordinates to blacklist file logger.

## 1.7.1

* Updated for v0.2.8.

## 1.7

* Updated for v0.2.6_02 and hMod b129.

## 1.5

* Removed the block lag fix.
* WorldGuard now conditionally loads features so you can use any up-to-date build of hMod and the unsupported features won't break the entire plugin. When WG loads, check the server console for a report of features that are not supported by your version of hMod.
* Changed some configuration defaults: disable-lava-fire=true simulate-sponge=true item-durability=false

## 1.4.1

* Fixed issue with the block lag fix dropping item stacks of 0 quantity.

## 1.4

* New on-acquire hook. This does both a total inventory check on inventory change and item pick up denial. The item pick up denial is largely thanks to Dinnerbone for fulfilling my request to add a particular hook.
* Item durability can now be toggled with item-durability. Thanks to Dinnerbone for figuring this out while filfilling my request. The default setting is to fix item durability.
* New no-physics-gravel and no-physics-sand options allow you to prevent gravel and sand from falling.
* New allow-portal-anywhere option allows you to create portal blocks anywhere. 

## 1.3

* UPGRADE WARNING: If you are using database logging, you must add a NULL 'comment' VARCHAR field to the table. The line of SQL that you can run for MySQL can be found in blacklist_table.sql.
* Improved plugin compatibility with the block lag fix. For maximum compatibility, you must now list WorldGuard as the first plugin in server.properties and you cannot reload or enable the plugin while the server is up. This is for bad plugins that unnecessarily use the "critical" priority for its hooks like the LWC. Most plugins don't do that though, so this won't apply for most people.
* Fixed signs being blank if they were denied via the blacklist.
* Added on-break event to the blacklist.
* Added comments and messages. Comments are only for your own use and they are printed with the log and notify actions of the blacklist. The message replaces the message that is shown the user and it is optional.
* The blacklist notification messages are now more compact and are light grey instead of light purple.
* The notify, log, and tell actions will now trigger every time for the on-break, on-create, on-drop events rather than wait 3 seconds between events for the same item or block for a player.

## 1.2

* /stopfire and /allowfire disable and enable fire spreading globally.
* Block lag fix slightly improved in accuracy for item drops.
* Sponge updated to remove water when the sponge block is set. Sponge radius can now be controlled using the 'sponge-radius' parameter and the default is now set to simulate Classic.
* Updated for a newer build of "b126," meaning that lava spread control now works well!
* A new summary of the status of some core protections is now printed on start. Disable this with 'summary-on-start'.
* Blacklist system has been overhauled. Check README.txt for changed configuration settings!
* The blacklist's method of preventing notification repeats is now better, instead waiting 3 seconds before notifying again (before it didn't notify again at all unless the user started using another blocked action).
* To give users the ability to receive notifications, the command to give permission to has been changed to /worldguardnotify, although the old one (that was never mentioned anywhere) still works.
* Water and lava buckets are now psuedo-blocked using an unreliable method that risks the stability of your server (no other plugin does it better though). Use it as your own risk.
* Added on item drop and on item use (i.e. chest) events.
* Chests, signs, and furnaces can now be blocked better with the blacklist system.
* The event names in the blacklist configuration have changed but the old event names should still work. The new names should make "more sense."
* A new "ban" action has been added to the blacklist.
* Action messages have been improved, now longer saying "destroyed" for everything.
* Logging to file has been completely changed, allowing you to use the date and time and the player's username in the log filename. It no longer rotates log files based on size, however.
* Logging to database is now supported.
* Tools can now be destroyed on drop to alleviate the durability cheat. You can do this with either with the blacklist or with the 'item-drop-blacklist' configuration option. The configuration option prints more friendly messages than the 'tell' action of blacklists.

## 1.1.2

* Block lag fix: Snow and glass should no longer drop items.
* Block lag fix: Block object now reset after hook call.

## 1.1.1
