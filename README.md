WorldGuard lets you and players guard areas of land against griefers and undesirables, as well as tweak and disable various gameplay features of Minecraft.

* Block creeper and wither block damage, falling damage, etc.
* Disable fire spread, lava fire spread, ice formation, Endermen picking up blocks, etc.
* Blacklist certain items and blocks so they can't be used
* Warn moderators when certain items and blocks are used
* Protect areas of your world so only certain people can build in them
* Set areas where PVP, TNT, mob damage, and other features are disabled
* Protect your server from various 'exploits' like magical obsidian creation machines
* Disable, or enable, various Minecraft features, like sponges from classic
* Add useful commands like an immediate "STOP ALL FIRE SPREAD" command
* Enable only features you want! Everything is off by default
