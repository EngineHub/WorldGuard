WorldGuard is a toolbox of various functions, useful for multiplayer servers, that lets you:

* Protect your server from a number of problems.
* Block fire spread, lava spread, endermen, and more.
* Flag areas as "no PVP" or "no TNT."
* Assign ownership to areas so only selected individuals can build.
* Use a number of useful commands.
