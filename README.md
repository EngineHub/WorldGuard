WorldGuard
==========

WorldGuard protects your Minecraft server. As Minecraft's oldest surviving world protection mod, you know you're in safe hands.

Compiling
---------

You need to have Maven installed (http://maven.apache.org). Once installed,
simply run:

    mvn clean install
    
Maven will automatically download dependencies for you. Note: For that to work,
be sure to add Maven to your "PATH".
